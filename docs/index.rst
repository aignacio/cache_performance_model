About
-----

The Cache Performance Model is a Python-based simulation tool that helps computer architects and researchers analyze cache behavior and performance. It supports:

* Multiple cache levels and configurations
* Various replacement policies (LRU, FIFO, Random)
* Detailed performance metrics and statistics
* Customizable memory access patterns
* Statistical analysis and visualization tools

Features
--------

* **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to configure cache parameters
* **Performance Analysis**: Detailed hit/miss statistics
